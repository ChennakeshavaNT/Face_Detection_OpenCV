# ***FACE DETECTION*** 
Face detection refers to computer technology that is able to identify the presence of people's faces within digital images.

In Simple Terms- Face detection just means that a system is able to identify that there is a human face present in an image or video.


### ***This Repository contains Three different Approaches/Applications:***
- **FACE DETECTION IN IMAGES:-** This section deals with Face detection in static images.
- **FACE DETECTION IN NON REAL-TIME:-** This section deals with Face Detection for Video as input that previous recorded.
- **FACE DETECTION IN REAL-TIME:-** This section deals with Face Detection for Dynamic Video such as Video directly obtained from cameras that are recording in in Real-time

## ***TECH STACK (Built with):***
- Python 3
- Python Libraries Numpy, Matplotlib and OpenCV
- Pre-Trained Frontal-Face DataSet

## ***Getting Started***
