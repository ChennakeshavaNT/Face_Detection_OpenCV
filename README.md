# ***FACE DETECTION*** 
Face detection refers to computer technology that is able to identify the presence of people's faces within digital images.

In Simple Terms- Face detection just means that a system is able to identify that there is a human face present in an image or video.


### ***This Repository contains Three different Approaches/Applications:***
- **FACE DETECTION IN IMAGES:-** This section deals with Face detection in static images.
- **FACE DETECTION IN NON REAL-TIME:-** This section deals with Face Detection for Video as input that previous recorded.
- **FACE DETECTION IN REAL-TIME:-** This section deals with Face Detection for Dynamic Video such as Video directly obtained from cameras that are recording in in Real-time

## ***TECH STACK (Built with):***
- Python 3
- Python Libraries Numpy, Matplotlib and OpenCV
- Pre-Trained Frontal-Face DataSet

## ***Getting Started***
***1. Prequisites Installation:***
- ***Python 3***
1. Open command Prompt/ terminal
2. Type python and press enter (if python is already installed, control will go to python command prompt go to next step)
3. If you are getting error, then download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. After downloading install the executable.
- ***OpenCV version(4.4.0) or above***
1. Open command prompt/terminal
2. type import cv2 and press enter (if opencv is already installed, you  will not get any errors)
3. If your getting error "command not found", then use the command " pip install opencv-python"

- ***Numpy Version(1.19.1) or above***
1. Open command prompt/terminal
2. type import numpy and press enter (if numpy is already installed, you  will not get any errors)
- Matplotlib Version(3.3.1) or above
- Jupyter Notebook (or Any other IDE that can run .ipynb files)

***2. Execution:***
- Open Jupyter note book
- Upload the file.ipynb file 
- keep DataSet in the same folder as file.ipynb file
- Click run Option from menu or click "shift" + "enter" to run each cell one by one
